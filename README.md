About Leatherman
-------------

The Leatherman GEM is a collection of various class extensions for Rails & Ruby projects.

Why
-------------

This GEM was created primarily for me to 'DRY' on various client projects. I found myself copying over
these common class extensions from project to project. Perfect case for creating and sharing this GEM.

Compatibility
-------------

Leatherman is tested and used with Ruby 2.0.0 and Rails 4.0.x.

Note: It may work just fine with other Rubies/Rails; however, we've made no effort to test.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

TODO
-------------

* Write tests
* Write docs
* Abstract more extensions
* Test, Test, Test...
