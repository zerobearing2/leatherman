About Leatherman
-------------

The Leatherman GEM is a collection of various class extensions for Rails 3.x / Ruby 1.9.x projects.

Why
-------------

This GEM was created primiarly for me to 'DRY' on various client projects. I found myself copying over
these common class extensions from project to project. Perfect case for creating and sharing the GEM.

Compatibility
-------------

Leatherman is tested and used with Ruby 1.9.2 and Rails 3.1.x. 

Note: It may work just fine with other Rubies/Rails; however, we've made no effort to test.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

TODO
-------------

* Write specs.
* Abstract more extensions
* Test, Test, Test...
